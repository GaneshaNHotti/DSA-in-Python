## Problems List

| Problem Name                                             | Description | Solution                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| [Weird Algorithm](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1068/) | Given a number n, if n is even divide it by 2, if n is odd multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process until n becomes 1. | [Python](weird_algorithm.py) |
| [Missing Number](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1083/)  | You are given all numbers between 1,2,...,n except one. Your task is to find the missing number. | [Python](missing_number.py)  |
| [Repetitions](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1069/)  | You are given a DNA sequence: a string consisting of characters A, C, G, and T. Your task is to find the longest repetition in the sequence. This is a maximum-length substring containing only one type of character. | [Python](repetitions.py)     |
