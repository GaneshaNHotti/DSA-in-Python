| [Weird Algorithm](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1068/)  | Given a number n, if n is even divide it by 2, if n is odd multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process until n becomes 1.                                                                                                                                                | [Python](weird_algorithm.py)  |
| [Missing Number](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1083/)   | You are given all numbers between 1,2,...,n except one. Your task is to find the missing number.                                                                                                                                                                             | [Python](missing_number.py)   |
| [Repetitions](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1069/)      | You are given a DNA sequence: a string consisting of characters A, C, G, and T. Your task is to find the longest repetition in the sequence. This is a maximum-length substring containing only one type of character.                                                       | [Python](repetitions.py)      |
| [Increasing Array](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1094/) | You are given an array of n integers. You want to modify the array so that it is increasing, i.e., every element is at least as large as the previous element. On each move, you may increase the value of any element by one. What is the minimum number of moves required? | [Python](increasing_array.py) |
| [Permutations](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1070/)     | A permutation of integers 1,2,...,n is called beautiful if there are no adjacent elements whose difference is 1.                                                                                                                                                             | [Python](permutations.py)     |
